# Entity Resolution

## Description

Entity Resolution (ER) is the process of finding identical entities across different databases. Given the recent explosion of data, there are many different pieces of data across multiple sources which actually point to the same entity. For example, a sample user account on a given social media application likely requires roughly the same information that is needed to create an account on another social network, but, in all likelihood, that information may be stored differently in each application. Oftentimes, the same user can appear differently across different databases for multiple reasons. The user might misspell their data or they might decide to enter an alternate shortening of their data. In either case, the same person will appear, to most programs, as two separate entities. This problem, which is the most common matching bottleneck in Entity Resolution, is known as approximate matching.

The automata model to be a useful and efficient way to recognize and resolve instances of Entity Resolution problems. In this model, each automata uses fuzzy-matching techniques in order to recognize misspellings or alternate spellings of some piece of data. Additionally, these automata can be set to recognize arbitrary Hamming distance differences, which allows further customization when it comes to resolving approximate matches.

### Helpful and Instructive Images

The above image demonstrates the general type of setup each automaton has in the Entity Resolution solver. Note that the automaton in this image does not implement fuzzy matching, which is used to solve Entity Resolution instances efficiently. Instead, it is a direct-recognition automaton, which recognizes the name Adam Smith. In this automaton, the $ and # are meant to deal with unnecessary spaces in the input, the + signs are included for architecture-specific reasons and are not vital to the overall name-recognition process. Also, the “,” sign is a reporting state.

This image provides an instructive example of a Hamming distance automaton. Note that this automaton has the ability to recognize pieces of data with a Hamming distance of 0 or 1. In our implementation, the Hamming distance recognition properties of each automaton can be arbitrarily edited in order to recognize different Hamming distances.

## Automata

### 1000.1chip.anml
The ER standard automata was constructed by running the nametoanml.py script on the 1000.names input file. This script takes each name and converts it to a widget described above to recognize all other entries in a database within Hamming distance 1. Thus, there are 1000 ER widgets in the standard candle.


## Inputs
Input streams to ER automata consist of full names separated by ‘$’ delimiters. Each individual name is an independent problem and so no dependencies exist across ‘$’ boundaries.

The 1MB and 10MB input files were constructed using the 1000.names input file. Each name entry is concatenated together and delimited with a ‘$’ until the desired file size is created. The 1000.names input file was originally derived from the SNAC organization database

### 1000_1MB.input

Generated by delimiting the names in the 1000.names file using ‘$’.

### 1000_10MB.input

Generated by concatenating 1000_1MB.input.
