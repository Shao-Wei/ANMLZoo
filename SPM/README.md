# Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM)
## Description
Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a widely used data mining technique for discovering common sequences of events in large databases. When compared with the simple set mining problem and string mining problem, the hierarchical structure of sequential pattern mining (due to the need to consider frequent subsets within each itemset, as well as order among itemsets) and the resulting large permutation space makes SPM extremely expensive on conventional processor architectures.
