# RandomForest
## Description
### 300f_15t_from_model_MNIST.anml
A random forest with 15 trees and 300 features per input trained on the MNIST digit recognition library. This ANML file was generated as a part of the original ANMLZoo benchmark suite. It was generated incorrectly and thus should not be considered a "standard candle". However, it is a valid benchmark and is maintained for posterity.

### rf.1chip.anml
A portion of 300f_15t_from_model_MNIST.anml properly pruned to max out the resources of an AP chip.

## Inputs
### mnist_1MB.input

### mnist_10MB.input
