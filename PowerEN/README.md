# PowerEN
## Description
PowerEN is a synthetic regular expression benchmark suite developed by IBM. PowerEN is available at the following url (https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/PowerEN+PME+Public+Pattern+Sets). Benchmark automata were derived from a combination of regular expressions complex_001 and complex_002 and complex_003 regular expression sets. The input trace files were derived from the complx single context complx_00100.strace file.
