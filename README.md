# ANMLZoo Automata Processing Benchmark Suite

## Description
High-performance automata-processing engines are traditionally evaluated using a limited set of regular expressionrulesets. While regular expression rulesets are valid real-world examples of use cases for automata processing, they represent a small proportion of all use cases for automata-based computing. With the recent availability of architectures and software frameworks for automata processing, many new applications have been found to benefit from automata processing. These show a wide variety of characteristics that differ from prior, popular regular-expression benchmarks, and these should be considered when designing new systems for automata processing.
This paper presents ANMLZoo, a benchmark repository for automata-based applications as well as automata engines for both von-Neumann and reconfigurable dataflow architectures.
